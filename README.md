# 🎓 Student Record Management System (OOP in Python)

## 📖 About
This is a simple yet functional **Student Record Management System** built using Python’s **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
The system allows users to **add, view, update, and manage student records** efficiently.  
Student data is stored in a **JSON file**, making it lightweight and easy to run without a database.

✅ View details of a specific student  
✅ Update student information (Name, Class, Roll No, Marks)  
✅ Delete student records  
✅ View all student names at once  
✅ Automatically calculates **average marks**  
✅ Handles errors for invalid inputs & missing files
